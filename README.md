# ChatGPT-to-API
Create a fake API using ChatGPT's website

> ## IMPORTANT
> You will not get free support for this repository. This was made for my own personal use and documentation will continue to be limited as I don't really need documentation. You will find more detailed documentation in the Chinese docs by a contributor.

**API endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions.**

## Setup
    
### Authentication

Access token retrieval has been automated by [OpenAIAuth](https://github.com/acheong08/OpenAIAuth/) with account email & password.

`accounts.txt` - A list of accounts separated by new line 

Format:
```
email:password
...
```

All authenticated access tokens will store in `access_tokens.json`

Auto renew access tokens after 14 days

Caution! please use unblocked ip for authentication, first login to `https://chat.openai.com/` to check ip availability if you can.

### API Authentication (Optional)

Custom API keys for this fake API, just like OpenAI api

`api_keys.txt` - A list of API keys separated by new line

Format:
```
sk-123456
88888888
...
```
